## **Lab 1 - Basic C Programming and Control Flow**

* ### Question 1:
    Write a C program that prints the ID and grade of each student in a class. The input contains the student IDs and their marks. 
    The range of the marks is from 0 to 100. The relationships of the marks and grades are given below. Use the sentinel value –1 for 
    student ID to indicate the end of user input. Write the program using the switch statement.

    | Grade         | Mark          |
    | ------------- |:-------------:| 
    | A             | 100‐75        | 
    | B             | 74‐65         |
    | C             | 64‐55         |
    | D             | 54‐45         |
    | F             | 44‐0          |


* ### Question 2:
    Write a C program that reads in several lines of non‐negative integer numbers, computes the average for each line and prints 
    out the average. The value –1 in each line of user input is used to indicate the end of input for that line.


* ### Question 3:
    Write a C program that accepts a positive number height between 1 and 10 as its parameter value, and prints a triangular pattern 
    according to height. Note that only 1, 2 and 3 are used to generate the patterns. 
    
    A sample input and output session when the program is called is given. For example, pattern(2) will print the following pattern:


    1


    22


    333




    while pattern(7) will print the following pattern:


    1


    22


    333


    1111


    22222


    333333


    1111111
