## **Lab 5 - Procedural Abstraction (Function and Module)**

* ### Learning Objectives
    Students will learn how to apply the concept of procedural abstraction in the form of function for easy re-use, and further extend it to a module to make the function sharable by multiple programs.

* ### Intended Learning Outcomes
    At the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

    * write a commonly use block of code in the form of function and module.

* ### Equipment and accessories required
    * Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPi3) board with Sense HAT add-on display module/board.
    * A USB power source to power the RPi3 board (E.g. Power Bank, Adaptor or USB
    port of a desktop computer).
    * A computer (desktop PC or notebook) with Ethernet port and cable for remote
    access of RPi3. Software (open source) to be installed on the computer â€“ PuTTY,
    VNC Viewer and WinSCP.
