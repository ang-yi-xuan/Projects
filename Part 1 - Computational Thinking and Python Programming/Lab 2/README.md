--- 


## **Lab 2 - Basic Python Programming**

* ### Learning Objectives
    Students will learn how to write simple Python programs through hands-on coding exercises on the Raspberry Pi. It also shows how variables and data types can be useful when coding program.


* ### Intended Learning Outcomes
    At the end of this exercise, you should:
    * Know the basic structure of a Python program.
    * Make use of variables and different data types in the program.


* ### Equipment and accessories required
    * Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPi3) board with Sense HAT add-on display module/board.
    * A USB power source to power the RPi3 board (E.g. Power Bank, Adaptor or USB port of a desktop computer).
    * A computer (desktop PC or notebook) with Ethernet port and cable for remote access of RPi3. Software (open source) to be installed on the computer – PuTTY, VNC Viewer, ‘MS Remote Desktop Connection’ and WinSCP.
