## **Lab 6 - Decomposition**

* ### Learning Objectives
    Students will use the concept of decomposition, the divide and conquer technique to break a problem into smaller and simpler parts, and together with other concepts and techniques that you have learnt in this course, develop an algorithm to implement a game.

* ### Intended Learning Outcomes
    At the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

    * know how to use the decomposition strategy to break a problem into a set of component parts and implements them in the form of functions, which together lead to the solution of the problem.

* ### Equipment and accessories required
    * Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPi3) board with Sense HAT add-on display module/board.
    * A USB power source to power the RPi3 board (E.g. Power Bank, Adaptor or USB
    port of a desktop computer).
    * A computer (desktop PC or notebook) with Ethernet port and cable for remote
    access of RPi3. Software (open source) to be installed on the computer â€“ PuTTY,
    VNC Viewer and WinSCP.
