# **CE1103 Part 1 - Computational Thinking and Python Programming**

## **Lab 1 - Introduction to RPi**


* ### Learning Objectives
In this course, students will learn the various concepts of computational thinking
through programming exercises performed on the Raspberry Pi platform. This
laboratory exercise is to introduce students to the Raspberry Pi (RPi) single-board
computer, and how to use its text-based (Linux’s bash) commands to explore the
environment of the RPi.


* ### Intended Learning Outcomes
At the end of this exercise, you should be able to
⋅⋅1. Operate the Raspberry Pi board through its Graphic User Interface and through its
Terminal mode interface.
⋅⋅2. Write basic programs in Python language and C language to observe the difference
in running an interpreted language and a compiled language based programs.


* ### Equipment and accessories required
1. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPi3) board with Sense HAT add-on display
module/board.
2. PC


## **Lab 2 - Basic Python Programming**


* ### Learning Objectives
Students will learn how to write simple Python programs through hands-on coding exercises on the Raspberry Pi. It also shows how variables and data types can be useful when coding program.


* ### Intended Learning Outcomes
At the end of this exercise, you should:
1. know the basic structure of a Python program.
2. be able to make use of variables and different data types in the program.


* ### Equipment and accessories required
1. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPi3) board with Sense HAT add-on display module/board.
2. A USB power source to power the RPi3 board (E.g. Power Bank, Adaptor or USB port of a desktop computer).
3. A computer (desktop PC or notebook) with Ethernet port and cable for remote access of RPi3. Software (open source) to be installed on the computer – PuTTY, VNC Viewer, ‘MS Remote Desktop Connection’ and WinSCP.
