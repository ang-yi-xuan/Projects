# **CE1103 Part 1 - Computational Thinking and Python Programming**
--- 


## **Lab 3 - Basic Python Programming - Conditional Executions and Iterations**

* ### Learning Objectives
    Students will learn how to apply the relational operations, selections and repetition to implement robust programs through coding exercises on the Raspberry Pi.

* ### Intended Learning Outcomes
    At the end of this exercise, you should be able to
    * Apply the concept of relational operations with selection to form conditional expressions.
    * Make use of iteration in your program to perform repetitive tasks.

* ### Equipment and accessories required
    * Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPi3) board with Sense HAT add-on display module/board.
    * A USB power source to power the RPi3 board (E.g. Power Bank, Adaptor or USB
    port of a desktop computer).
    * A computer (desktop PC or notebook) with Ethernet port and cable for remote
    access of RPi3. Software (open source) to be installed on the computer â€“ PuTTY,
    VNC Viewer and WinSCP.
