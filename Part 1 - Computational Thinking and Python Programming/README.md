# CE1103 Part 1 - Computational Thinking and Python Programming

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Lab 1 - Introduction to RPi

### Learning Objectives
In this course, students will learn the various concepts of computational thinking
through programming exercises performed on the Raspberry Pi platform. This
laboratory exercise is to introduce students to the Raspberry Pi (RPi) single-board
computer, and how to use its text-based (Linuxâ€™s bash) commands to explore the
environment of the RPi.

### Intended Learning Outcomes
At the end of this exercise, you should be able to
1. Operate the Raspberry Pi board through its Graphic User Interface and through its
Terminal mode interface.
2. Write basic programs in Python language and C language to observe the difference
in running an interpreted language and a compiled language based programs.

### Equipment and accessories required
1. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPi3) board with Sense HAT add-on display
module/board.
2. PC
