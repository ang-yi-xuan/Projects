## **Lab 4 - Data Abstraction**

* ### Learning Objectives
    Students will learn how data abstraction can be used in program to support and simplify the implementation of an algorithm.

* ### Intended Learning Outcomes
    At the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

    * Make use of appropriate data structure to improve the structure of a program.
    * Apply various concepts learnt in earlier topics (conditional selection, looping) and various functions to develop more complex programs.

* ### Equipment and accessories required
    * Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPi3) board with Sense HAT add-on display module/board.
    * A USB power source to power the RPi3 board (E.g. Power Bank, Adaptor or USB
    port of a desktop computer).
    * A computer (desktop PC or notebook) with Ethernet port and cable for remote
    access of RPi3. Software (open source) to be installed on the computer â€“ PuTTY,
    VNC Viewer and WinSCP.
